# Multiplayer Pong Game ðŸŽ®

## ðŸ“– Description

Welcome to a classic Pong remake â€” rebuilt as a multiplayer, real-time browser game!  
This project explores real-time communication between multiple clients using WebSockets, managed via a Node.js server and a React frontend.  

Two players can connect to a central server, control paddles on their screens, and play against each other in real-time. The ball bounces off the walls and paddles. If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point. The entire game state is synchronized between both browsers through Socket.IO.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Clone the project repository** or download the provided files.
2. **Open two browser tabs or devices** and connect to the same game URL.
3. **Control your paddle using keyboard keys**:
   - Player 1: `W` (Up) and `S` (Down)
   - Player 2: `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down`
4. The ball moves automatically.  
   Your goal: prevent the ball from passing your paddle!  
   - If the ball hits your paddle: it bounces.
   - If you miss: your opponent scores.
5. The score updates in real-time on both playersâ€™ screens.

**Note:** The score only increases when the ball passes a paddle â€” not when it touches it.
