Project Specification: Multiplayer Pong Game
üìå Project Title:

Multiplayer Pong Game
üìå Project Description:

This project is a real-time, interactive multiplayer version of the classic Pong game. Two players connect via a central server, each controlling a paddle to hit a moving ball within a game area. The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and the players' paddles. If a player fails to return the ball, the opponent scores a point. The game state ‚Äî including paddle positions, ball position, and scores ‚Äî will be synchronized in real-time across both players‚Äô browsers using WebSockets via Socket.IO.

The project emphasizes full-stack development with React + TypeScript on the frontend, and a Node.js + TypeScript backend, focusing on real-time communication, distributed state management, and event-driven programming.
üìå Learning Objectives:

By completing this project, students will be able to:

    Implement real-time communication using WebSockets and Socket.IO.

    Develop a Node.js (TypeScript) backend responsible for authoritative game logic.

    Create a responsive and interactive React (TypeScript) frontend.

    Manage synchronized, distributed game state between multiple clients.

    Apply TypeScript effectively on both frontend and backend for type safety and maintainability.

    Understand and implement client-server data flow in a real-time interactive application.

üìå Technical Stack:

    Frontend: React + TypeScript

    Backend: Node.js + TypeScript

    Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO (WebSocket)

    Build Tools: Vite / Webpack for frontend bundling

    Package Manager: npm or yarn

    Version Control: Git + GitHub

üìå Core Functional Requirements:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Communication (30 Points)

    Integrate Socket.IO on both client and server.

    Establish WebSocket connections for two players.

    Emit and listen for custom events to synchronize:

        Paddle movements

        Ball position

        Score updates

2Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js Backend for Game Logic (30 Points)

    Set up a Node.js + TypeScript server.

    Implement:

        Game session management (pair two players per room).

        Core game mechanics:

            Ball movement logic

            Simple physics for bouncing

            Collision detection (ball with paddles and walls)

            Score tracking and updates

    Act as the authoritative source for game state.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive React Frontend (25 Points)

    Design a game UI showing:

        Game area

        Paddles

        Ball

        Player scores

    Capture and handle player inputs (keyboard events for moving paddles).

    Send inputs to the server via WebSockets.

    Update the UI dynamically based on game state received from the server.

4Ô∏è‚É£ TypeScript & Full-Stack Integration (15 Points)

    Use TypeScript across both backend and frontend projects.

    Share common type definitions between client and server for consistent data structures.

    Integrate all components into a seamless multiplayer experience.

    Demonstrate full understanding of real-time data flow between:

        Player ‚Üí Server

        Server ‚Üí All players

üìå Additional Requirements:

    Well-organized and commented codebase.

    Proper error handling on both client and server.

    Responsive and visually clean UI.

    Basic room management (2 players per room; waiting state if a player is alone).

    Real-time synchronization without noticeable lag.

üìå Deliverables:

    Complete source code (with package.json and README).

    Working multiplayer game hosted locally or online (optional for bonus).
